# Plan Your Shoot

## What shots to take?

Capture photos of local coastal areas that are subject to flooding or erosion. Take images where the impact of the tide can be gauged against familiar landmarks like buildings, jetties, bridges, roads, sea walls, shorelines, beach infrastructure or estuary shorelines.

If you can, take contrasting shots of peak high and peak low tide.  This helps show the tidal variability.  Time-lapse photography can also be quite striking.

## When to go?

The best time to take photos is at the peak of the tide when the water level is at its highest. The time of peak tide varies, so check with a King Tides organizer near you or, if you’re not in an area with an organizer, find a tide predictor here (open source Google document).

##What information to collect?

Remember to take note of the time, date, location, and orientation of your photos so that you can include this information when you share them. Take note of  the weather and anything interesting that you see.

### TIPS:

- Switch on the GPS device in your phone or camera, so that your photo will include the longitude and latitude coordinates.
- Snap a couple of shots. Try to include landmarks or infrastructure (bridges, roads, sidewalks) so that we can understand the orientation and get some clues about the depth of the water.
- Arrive at your chosen site a few minutes early.  Researchers can only use images that are taken within 45 minutes of the high tide peak, so the total window of time to take photographs is 1.5 hours (45 minutes before the peak, and 45 minutes after the peak)
- Be safe
- Scout out the area to ensure safety. Use good judgement when you are taking your photos. Stay away from dangerous situations particularly in stormy conditions and avoid taking risks.

## Make a day of it

Take your family and friends with you and participate together. Why not enjoy the event together and witness the future. If you are keen to coordinate a group of people, see the “Become an Organizer” page for tips. Also, we welcome your participation in our network’s collaboration and activities.

## Extra Credit

We can always use high tide / low tide comparisons, so if you have the time to come back to the same spot during the low tide please compare!
