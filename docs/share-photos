# Share with Decision Makers

Your local, state and national governments make decisions about how  natural places and infrastructure are managed on the coastline. It is helpful for them to see how they should be taking action to address the impacts of sea level rise, and the importance of reducing carbon emissions to prevent more severe impacts.
