# Using the King Tides Project Logo

A *relatively standard* King Tides Project Logo is used by initiatives around the world. We're an organic, open source collective, so we're not hung up on all having the exact same branding... we're more concerned about getting those photos!

The generic logo may be used by a local initiative. 

There are also examples of initiatives that have modified the logo to include the local chapter. For example:

You can use and modify any of the images in this repository for the purposes of promoting or running a King Tides Project initiative.
