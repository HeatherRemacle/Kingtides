## Welcome to KingTides Project GitHub Pages

The Kingtides community is a global network of people who organize events to raise awareness of global warming impacts on our shorelines, due to sea level rise. This repository hosts a basic Kingtides website anyone can copy to create their own local organizing site.

This repository also provides the source files for developing a customized Kingtides Project logo.
